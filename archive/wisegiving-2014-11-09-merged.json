In 1995, TREATS launched its pioneer programme “Integrated Youth Ambassadors Training Scheme”.  Through a series of intensive training and community services, young people of different backgrounds and abilities are being trained as TREATS Integration Ambassadors whose mission is to promote integration to their peers and members of the community.  Throughout the years, TREATS has trained more than 1,000 children and youth of different backgrounds and abilities to become TREATS Integration Ambassadors, who then reached out to 52,000 participants of the general public in promoting the concept of integration.", "4.

", "4) Developed the first low vision training programme for visually impaired in 1975 to train students to learn and read with their residual vision. The programme was successfully implemented. A low vision   training course was held for teachers/administrators in blind schools in South East Asia with the       assistance of Dr Jeanne Kenmore of American Foundation for the Blind in 1976.

", "6) With funding support form the Quality Education Fund and Drs Richard Charles & Esther Yewick Lee Charitable Foundation, started a pilot project “Early Intervention Programme for Visually Impaired Children” for a period of 2 year in 2000.  This project aimed to provide individual and home training service to new born babies/young children as well as counselling service to their parents. This service was well received and is now continually funded as a community project by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust.                                                                               ", "7) There has been a long waiting list in the early intervention programme for visually impaired children service (EIP). To address the need for timely assessment and intervention, we successfully supplemented the EIP with the seed project sponsored by Standard Chartered Hong Kong 150 Anniversary community Foundation via the Community Chest in April 2011.  The seed project has dual objectives – to provide needy children on the waiting list with some interim training during the training period and to collaborate with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University School of Optometry on a wider scale visual assessment for pre-school children so as to identify suitably and address their visual problems at an early stage.

", "10) Introduced play and art therapy services for visually impaired students in 2012 which aimed to strengthen their senses of identity, their self- worth and self-esteem.                              ", "11) To enable our visually impaired children to reach their full potential, an innovative photography programme was launched in April 2012. Under the guidance of a group of enthusiastic voluntary photographers, our students pioneered photography for the blind in Hong Kong. The photos taken by the students were publicly exhibited at private art gallery, MTR station, Academy of Visual Arts of HK Baptist University and Fringe Club. It was widely reported in the media. The one at the Fringe Club was one of the highlights of the Hong Kong International Photos Exhibition 2012.

Refugees rely on charity meal services to supplement their social services food provisions. Vision First has partnered with a local restaurant and a private funder to fill this gap. The Vision First Food Program has the additional benefit of providing members the right to choose their own meal. This simple freedom is greatly appreciated by our members who are usually denied the freedom to choose their meals.", "6.\tEducational Support - Vision First helps children between the ages of 5 and 14 to find school placements and provides financial assistance for textbooks, uniforms, transportation, excursions and homework support classes.

For adolescents and adults, Vision First offers vocational training programs.", "7.\tYouth Support Group - Vision First holds weekly activities for unaccompanied minors. These refugees are young adolescent men and women who have arrived in Hong Kong with no immediate family or guardianship.

This group enables adolescent members to seek guidance and support from our facilitators, and share, support and learn from one another.", "8.\tRefugee Health Clinic – This program brings expert medical care to our members and the broader refugee community.

This primary care will include: medical consultation and examination, health education on hygiene and lifestyle, referral system, medication and follow-ups in person and by phone/email. ", "9.\tPersonal Development Program – Most refugees who arrive in Hong Kong have experienced some form of physical and/ or psychological trauma. This can include torture and/or the loss of family members to violence, disease or poverty. These experiences can naturally cause a person to have difficulty sleeping, nightmares, feelings of fear and anxiety, sadness, hopelessness, grief, and pain. The vital services of our Mental Health Program include - Counseling, Psychotherapy and Coaching, Positive Parenting Groups and Workshops, Groups and Workshops for specific purposes (eg. smoking cessation).", "10.\tFootball Program – Vision First works with members to coordinate monthly football matches.

We plan to expand this program to include women’s sports with future funding and volunteer support.", "11.\tPublic Awareness Program - VF raises public awareness of the plight of refugees. Public understanding is primarily driven by negative media reports and negative public sentiment towards refugees is a precursor to isolating the already vulnerable refugee community. ", "VF builds awareness through public education. ", "12.\tVolunteer Program - Vision First is 100% powered by volunteers; relying solely on volunteer expertise and support to run day-to-day operations. Aside from the core team, anyone can volunteer their time to create their own short or long-term program. Vision First collaborates with the broader community of professionals to expand and enhance our current operations. Current volunteer contributions include ongoing free medical consultations, writing funding proposals, content editing and website management, study tutors, photography teachers, language instructors, kids activity leaders and health education facilitators. Fundraising is another way to meaningfully contribute to the refugee community.
