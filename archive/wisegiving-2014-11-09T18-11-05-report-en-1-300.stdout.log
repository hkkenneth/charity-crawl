RAHK and other members of the \u201cHalf-fare Concession for People with Disabilities Alliance\u201d had undergone different petitions and the lobbying work with the transport service providers. We hope to voice out the needs of people with disabilities to have the half-fare concession through the action.',

And the role of the Access and Built Environment Group (ABEG) is very essential as they can reflect their needs through our personal experience. Thus, we sincerely hope that all of you will keep on giving support to ABEG. As \u201cDesign Manual: Barrier Free Access 1997\u201d of the Building Department consultation was coming to the final stage, we would be proactive to express our opinion in the viewpoint of \u201cuser\u201d. In addition, we participated in the 2005/06 Rehabilitation Programme Plan Evaluation, we expressed our opinion to the Government and hoped that the Plan can meet the needs of people with disabilities.',
	                  u'Moreover, we had great development in the aspect of social enterprise. In spite of running our third 7-Eleven Convenience Store in East Point City, Tseung Kwan O, we also developed another project in the aspect of social enterprise, RA Health First. It mainly focuses on selling rehabilitation and health product, wheelchair and its accessories. We organized the RA Health First and expected to run it in mid-2006. We believe that after the opening of RA Health First, we not only provide services to people with disabilities, but also create more job opportunities for them. Further, there were different parties visiting our social enterprise such as representatives of the social service organization from Australia as to exchange the views on social enterprise management.',
	                  u'In media response, RAHK expressed our opinion in different issues related to disability, such as transport and access etc, For instance, we felt discontented about Social Welfare Department increased the grant of 1 billion to support services to people with disabilities but did not address the problem of heavy transportation cost of them. This limited the opportunity for people with disabilities to integrate into the society. We will keep close contact with the mass media as to express the needs of people with disabilities. Details can refer to the content of the Annual Report.',
	                  u'Further, our subsidiary organization, Association of Women with Disabilities continues to co-operate with different rehabilitation and non-service organizations. We are also proactive in joining local and international forum and seminars. We participated in Women\u2019s World 2005 (WW05), the 9th International Interdisciplinary Congress on Women in Seoul, the 10th AWID International Forum on Women\u2019s Rights and Development in Bangkok, and the 2 days intensive exchange tours with Disabled Women Delegates from Guangzhou Province, etc. In the coming years, we believe that health care issues of women with disabilities becoming much more important, therefore we promote health care needs of women with disabilities. We had training workshops with the Health Department which helped the public had better knowledge of the needs of people with disabilities.'],

All of us say NO to poverty. ",
	                  u'Here at Oxfam Hong Kong, we are improving livelihoods and influencing policies with a multi-pronged strategy, through our powerful one programme approach, successful partnerships, and rights-based approach.',

	{'achievements': [u'Last year, we continuously promoted the employment opportunity and concessionary fare for people with disabilities. RAHK and other members of the \u201cHalf-fare Concession for People with Disabilities Alliance\u201d had undergone different petitions and the lobbying work with the transport service providers. We hope to voice out the needs of people with disabilities to have the half-fare concession through the action.',
	                  u'About the barrier-free environment, we continue to reflect our opinion to the Government and the transport service providers. And the role of the Access and Built Environment Group (ABEG) is very essential as they can reflect their needs through our personal experience. Thus, we sincerely hope that all of you will keep on giving support to ABEG. As \u201cDesign Manual: Barrier Free Access 1997\u201d of the Building Department consultation was coming to the final stage, we would be proactive to express our opinion in the viewpoint of \u201cuser\u201d. In addition, we participated in the 2005/06 Rehabilitation Programme Plan Evaluation, we expressed our opinion to the Government and hoped that the Plan can meet the needs of people with disabilities.',
	                  u'Moreover, we had great development in the aspect of social enterprise. In spite of running our third 7-Eleven Convenience Store in East Point City, Tseung Kwan O, we also developed another project in the aspect of social enterprise, RA Health First. It mainly focuses on selling rehabilitation and health product, wheelchair and its accessories. We organized the RA Health First and expected to run it in mid-2006. We believe that after the opening of RA Health First, we not only provide services to people with disabilities, but also create more job opportunities for them. Further, there were different parties visiting our social enterprise such as representatives of the social service organization from Australia as to exchange the views on social enterprise management.',
	                  u'In media response, RAHK expressed our opinion in different issues related to disability, such as transport and access etc, For instance, we felt discontented about Social Welfare Department increased the grant of 1 billion to support services to people with disabilities but did not address the problem of heavy transportation cost of them. This limited the opportunity for people with disabilities to integrate into the society. We will keep close contact with the mass media as to express the needs of people with disabilities. Details can refer to the content of the Annual Report.',
	                  u'Further, our subsidiary organization, Association of Women with Disabilities continues to co-operate with different rehabilitation and non-service organizations. We are also proactive in joining local and international forum and seminars. We participated in Women\u2019s World 2005 (WW05), the 9th International Interdisciplinary Congress on Women in Seoul, the 10th AWID International Forum on Women\u2019s Rights and Development in Bangkok, and the 2 days intensive exchange tours with Disabled Women Delegates from Guangzhou Province, etc. In the coming years, we believe that health care issues of women with disabilities becoming much more important, therefore we promote health care needs of women with disabilities. We had training workshops with the Health Department which helped the public had better knowledge of the needs of people with disabilities.'],

We use the unique medium of experiential learning, games and a variety of activities to bring together children, youth and families from varying backgrounds and with differing abilities, providing them with opportunities for equal participation and interaction, learning appreciation and acceptance of one another, developing personal and social skills.

In December 2006, TREATS conducted the first local research study to examine on the concept of Integration in Hong Kong.  The study is not only an empirical investigation on Integration, it is also a valuable reference for the community.',
	                  u'3. In 1995, TREATS launched its pioneer programme \u201cIntegrated Youth Ambassadors Training Scheme\u201d.  Through a series of intensive training and community services, young people of different backgrounds and abilities are being trained as TREATS Integration Ambassadors whose mission is to promote integration to their peers and members of the community.  Throughout the years, TREATS has trained more than 1,000 children and youth of different backgrounds and abilities to become TREATS Integration Ambassadors, who then reached out to 52,000 participants of the general public in promoting the concept of integration.',
	                  u'4. The pilot \u201cIntegration Education Programme\u201d for primary schools was introduced in 2000.  The curriculum included a series of cohesive themes on the concept of integration, specially tailor-made for primary students.  Creative media tools and activities were also used to convey the message.',

After training, corporate volunteers will become partners of the children and they will work together with equal participation and acceptance, creating a unique experience of integration.

Hence, basing on the teachings from the gospel, we help drug addicts to free themselves from their problems and entanglements. We guide clients to reorganize their life through professional counseling, thus develop their potentials, rebuild positive interpersonal relationship and integrate them to the society. Moreover, we encourage the rehabilitated clients to contribute back to the society, and train them to be the disciples of Jesus Christ and serve the drug abusers community.'],

	              u'(i) Immigration and Documentation - The first step we take is to ensure that women and mothers, and their children have formal identity documentation which comply with the laws of Hong Kong. PathFinders cannot work with any person who does not comply with Hong Kong laws.',

While some mothers can send their children home to relatives and reapply for employment in Hong Kong, the majority must either return home permanently or at least return home prior to looking for work in other countries. Many women find their only option is to make an adoption plan in Hong Kong for their children.',

	              u'(iii) \u201cChild Development\u201d program focuses on development through play for children aged one year and older. Child development experts regularly observe these interactions to identify children with developmental delays or behavioural problems and then work individually with the mothers to understand and offer advice to overcome these issues.',

These experiences can naturally cause a person to have difficulty sleeping, nightmares, feelings of fear and anxiety, sadness, hopelessness, grief, and pain. The vital services of our Mental Health Program include - Counseling, Psychotherapy and Coaching, Positive Parenting Groups and Workshops, Groups and Workshops for specific purposes (eg. smoking cessation).',
	              u'10.\tFootball Program \u2013 Vision First works with members to coordinate monthly football matches. Our members organize the logistics and their own teams while Vision First funds the cost of transportation to and from the venue, and provides water, snacks, uniforms and equipment. We plan to expand this program to include women\u2019s sports with future funding and volunteer support.',
	              u'11.\tPublic Awareness Program - VF raises public awareness of the plight of refugees. Public understanding is primarily driven by negative media reports and negative public sentiment towards refugees is a precursor to isolating the already vulnerable refugee community. ',
	              u'VF builds awareness through public education. ',
	              u'12.\tVolunteer Program - Vision First is 100% powered by volunteers; relying solely on volunteer expertise and support to run day-to-day operations. Aside from the core team, anyone can volunteer their time to create their own short or long-term program. Vision First collaborates with the broader community of professionals to expand and enhance our current operations. Current volunteer contributions include ongoing free medical consultations, writing funding proposals, content editing and website management, study tutors, photography teachers, language instructors, kids activity leaders and health education facilitators. Fundraising is another way to meaningfully contribute to the refugee community. '],
